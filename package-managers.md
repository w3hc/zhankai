# Installation objectives

Ideally, yes, if the installation script is well-designed, users should be able to simply type "zhankai" in their terminal to run the app after using the curl command. However, there are a few important considerations:

1. Path addition: The installation script would need to add the zhankai executable to the user's PATH. This typically involves:
   - Placing the executable in a standard location (e.g., /usr/local/bin on Unix-like systems)
   - Or adding the installation directory to the user's PATH environment variable

2. Shell configuration: If the PATH is modified, the script might need to update the user's shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc) and prompt them to restart their terminal or source the updated configuration.

3. Permissions: The script would need to ensure that the installed executable has the correct permissions to be run by the user.

4. Multiple shells: If the user uses multiple shells, the script should ideally configure zhankai for all of them.

5. System vs. user installation: The script should handle both system-wide installations (requiring sudo) and user-specific installations appropriately.

6. Dependencies: If zhankai has any runtime dependencies, the script should check for and possibly install them.

To ensure this smooth experience, the installation script should:

1. Detect the user's environment (OS, shell, etc.)
2. Install zhankai in an appropriate location
3. Update PATH if necessary
4. Set correct permissions
5. Provide clear output about what it's doing and any next steps required

With a well-implemented installation script, users should indeed be able to simply type "zhankai" to run the app immediately after installation. However, in some cases, they might need to open a new terminal window or source their updated shell configuration first.

It's also good practice for the script to output instructions at the end, such as:

```
Installation complete! You can now run zhankai by typing 'zhankai' in your terminal.
If it doesn't work immediately, try opening a new terminal window or running 'source ~/.bashrc' (or your appropriate shell config file).
```

This approach provides a smooth, user-friendly installation experience across different systems and shells.
